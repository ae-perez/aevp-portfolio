          Hello there! I'm Alejandra, a software full-stack engineer by day and
          a creative owl by night.

          In the digital realm, I weave code like a wizard, turning complex
          problems into elegantly simple solutions. My keyboard is my wand, and
          with each keystroke, I bring functionality and efficiency to life.
          But wait, there's more to me than just 1s and 0s! When I'm
          not busy debugging or deploying, you can find me exploring the wild
          frontiers of creativity. Whether it's creating a new spotify playlist,
          writing in my journal about my future aspirations, or doodling in my
          sketchbook, I believe in adding a splash of color to everything I do.
          
          My journey through the tech landscape is fueled by endless
          curiosity and a hearty appetite for learning. From the nitty-gritty of
          back-end development to the finesse of front-end design, I love all
          things tech. But it's not just about the code; it's about the stories
          we can tell and the experiences we can create through technology.
          
          So, if you're looking for someone who can code with precision
          and brainstorm with imagination, you're in the right place. Let's
          blend logic with creativity and see where this adventure takes us!

        "The Schedule Utilization feature was ingeniously crafted for paid analytics users, aimed at enhancing their ability to efficiently monitor and analyze how their employees allocate time during a workday or week. This innovation primarily serves to facilitate more accurate forecasting of future staff availability.\n\n At the core of its functionality, the feature is intuitively integrated into the scheduling page. Users encounter a prominent Utilization button positioned strategically at the top right corner of the calendar. Upon interacting with this button, a modal springs to life, revealing an insightful Looker graph. This graph is not merely a visual treat but a functional marvel, clearly delineating the distribution of an employee's busy and available time slots across the selected time frame, be it a day or a week.\n\n The development journey of this feature was marked by extensive research, delving into the intricacies of integrating Looker API calls within embedded iframes. The team navigated the complexities of ensuring seamless functionality in conjunction with older blade files, all while meticulously addressing any potential formatting issues that might arise in LookML. This rigorous research and careful consideration in development underscore the team's commitment to delivering a feature that is not only technologically sound but also user-centric, significantly simplifying the task of schedule management for analytics users.",

This feature becomes accessible upon subscription, with a dedicated button appearing prominently on the main navigation bar.\n\n Engaging with this button transports users to a specialized page, seamlessly incorporating Google's BI tool within an iframe. This integration forms the core of the Advanced Analytics experience, offering users an array of pre-created dashboards, explores, and looks. These tools are meticulously designed to present a diverse range of statistics in a visually captivating and intuitive format, enabling users to glean valuable insights effortlessly.\n\n One of the standout aspects of this feature is its customization capability. Users are not limited to predefined data visualizations; they have the freedom to craft their own dashboards, explores, and looks. This personalization extends further, allowing users to save their custom creations for easy access from the main Advanced Analytics page. This level of user autonomy and flexibility underscores our commitment to providing a versatile and user-centric analytical tool.\n\n While delivering real-time analytics posed a challenge, our team ingeniously developed an algorithm that ensures data is updated with only a minimal delay, typically just a few minutes. This near real-time capability represents a significant stride in data accuracy and timeliness.\n\n Looking ahead, one of our ambitious goals is to evolve this feature to offer real-time analytics. This enhancement aims to mirror the dynamic nature of each bank's data, providing an even more immediate and accurate reflection of current metrics. The pursuit of this goal highlights our ongoing commitment to innovation and excellence in data analysis, continually seeking to elevate the user experience and provide cutting-edge solutions to our clients.",
